# What is StanleyMatlab?
* A Matlab/Simulink implementation of Stanley along with an off the shelf Bicycle model Simulink model and real time plotting.  

The Readme is still underwork.  

## How to use Stanley Matlab  
* Run the setup.m file, it should open up Simulink and the vehicle will start tracking a predetermined path in the setup.m file.

## How to visualize the performance of the Stanley Controller and Tuning
* Under ```StanleyFunctions/prototype_or_testing``` run ```plot_travel_vs_path```, the script should plot the desired path versus actual traveled positions.

## Acknowledgement  
* Marc Compere and his work in developing the model with real time plotting in Simulink.
